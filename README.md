Cardinal is a simple [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) (flash-card) app with Markdown support. It uses a [standard algorithm](https://www.supermemo.com/english/ol/sm2.htm) to schedule your flash cards for review based on how easily you recall their answers.

## Demo
